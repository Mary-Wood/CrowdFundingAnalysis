# CrowdFundingAnalysis
This is the repository for the school project analyzing a crowd funding project
In this project I analyzed a few questions to determine the viability of several Kickstarter/CrowdFunding ideas. 

##Initial Task
This assignment started with a client wanting data to crownfund her play, with a budget of over $10,000. However, the client wants to know if this is a achievable goal. The client specifically  wants to know what factors would set her up for success. To do this, I will analyze Crowdfunding data to determine what data can tell us about other crowdfunding trends. 

##Data Analysis
The data provided for this task can be found in the Excel sheet under the tab "Kickstarter". There were 15 columns representing data from Crownfunding campaigns in a variety of countries, catagories, with start and end dates (formatted as UNIX timestamps) and their crowding funding goals vs. pledged funding.
To complete the analyses, I compared trends and statistics on failed vs. successful US Kickstarters, as well as the breakdown of successful kickstarter campaigns on Theater in general and then Plays specifically as well as general trends over time. 

##Findings
In general, the trends for theater and play kickstarters looked very positive for the client. 
Over 60% of theater kickstarters were successful with over 60% of play kickstarters also being successful. However, this did lend to asking questions on why certain campaigns were successful while others were not.
