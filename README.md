#Crowd Funding Analysis
---
This is the repository for the school project analyzing a crowd funding project
In this project I analyzed a few questions to determine the viability of several Kickstarter/CrowdFunding ideas. 

##Initial Task 
This assignment started with a client wanting data to crowdfund her play, with a budget of over $10,000. However, the client wants to know if this is an achievable goal. The client specifically wants to know what factors would set her up for success. To do this, I will analyze Crowdfunding data to determine what data can tell us about other crowdfunding trends. 

##Data Analysis
The data provided for this task can be found in the Excel sheet under the tab "Kickstarter". There were 15 columns representing data from crowd funding campaigns in a variety of countries, categories, with start and end dates (formatted as UNIX timestamps) and their crowding funding goals vs. pledged funding.
To complete the analyses, I compared trends and statistics on failed vs. successful US Kickstarters, as well as the breakdown of successful Kickstarter campaigns on Theater in general and then Plays specifically as well as general trends over time. 

##Findings
In general, the trends for theater and play Kickstarters looked very positive for the client. 
Over 60% of theater Kickstarters were successful with over 60% of play Kickstarters also being successful. However, this did lend to asking questions on why certain campaigns were successful while others were not.
It appears a campaign’s success may have to do with two factors: The month that the campaign started and the amount of the fund goal. 
According to the data (shown in Outcomes Based on Launch Date.png) the best months for successful campaigns were February, May, and June. In July failed campaigns began to rise and successful campaigns fell. 
However, another impactful aspect was the campaign goal. Drilling down into failed and successful US play Kickstarters gives us a deeper view of the statistical trends of both categories. The goals of the successful campaigns averaged around $5,000, while failed campaigns averaged around $10,000. The IQR shows that the goals were much more varied for failed campaigns ($8,000), than successful campaigns ($3,500). 

##Educated Feedback for Client
According to this data, the client’s planned goal does not have a high probability for success. However, with a budget about half of what was planned ($5,000) and starting the campaign in May or June would present the highest likelihood of success for the client.
